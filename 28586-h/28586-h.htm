<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>These stories are founded on memories of my childhood
on the farm. They first took definite form in response to
the requests of my own little boys: "Tell me about when
you were little, Mama." Some of them were demanded over
and over again; but it remained for Bobby, the youngest, to
insist that they be "put into a book."</p>

<p>Many a time, after listening to one of them, he would
say: "I wish you would write your stories, Mama, so that
other children could hear them."</p>

<p>Always I replied: "I will try sometime."</p>

<p>But never did the time come when there were not other
things to do.</p>

<p>Finally, one night, when I had finished telling, "How
Rover Got the Cows out of the Corn," he said: "Mama,
you always say you will write your stories, but you never
do. Truly, I'm afraid the other children will never know
them."</p>

<p>I looked up. There were tears in Bobby's eyes.</p>

<p>Did it mean so much to him? Would other children like
the stories?</p>

<p>"Bobby," I said, "truly, I will try to write them. After
Christmas I will begin."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p>So after the holidays were over and the older boys had
gone back to college, the writing was commenced.</p>

<p>"Will they do?" said I to Bobby when he had heard the
last story read. "Do you think a publisher will like them?"</p>

<p>"The children will like them," he replied.</p>

<p>So that is how Prince and Rover happened to be written.</p>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>


<p>At Cloverfield Farm there were four
horses&mdash;Dobbin and Bird, Dan and
Daisy. Dan was getting old so he
could not go fast or work hard any
more.</p>

<p>"We need another horse," said Farmer
Hill one morning. "Mr. Ross
has some for sale. I am going over to
look at them to-day and perhaps I will
buy one."</p>

<p>"I hope," said John, "that you will
get one that can go fast&mdash;faster than
Daisy."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope," said Sue, "that you will
get a fine-looking horse."</p>

<p>"And I hope," said mother, "that
you will get a gentle horse, one that
will be safe for me to drive."</p>

<p>"I will try to please you all," said
father, "but first of all we must have a
strong, willing horse&mdash;one that will do
his share of the farm work."</p>

<p>Father was gone all day, for Farmer
Ross lived five miles away.</p>

<p>Toward supper-time Sue looked out
of the window and exclaimed: "Oh,
there's father with the new horse."</p>

<p>Just then Bobby came running in
and shouted: "Father's coming with
the new horse."</p>

<p>All three looked toward the road&mdash;mother
and John and Sue.</p>

<p>Down the road was father in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
buggy, driving Daisy while he led the
new horse behind the buggy with a
halter.</p>

<p>All the family went out to see the
new horse when Farmer Hill reached
the back yard.</p>

<p>"He is not as handsome as I had
hoped," said Sue, "but he has a kind
face."</p>

<p>"Can he go fast?" asked John.</p>

<p>"He is not a race-horse," said father,
"but he has long, slim legs and can go
over the ground pretty fast&mdash;quite fast
enough for us."</p>

<p>"Is he gentle, so that I can drive
him?" asked mother.</p>

<p>"Yes," said father, "he is a safe
horse. He will not jump or run
away even if you meet a threshing
machine."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad of that," said mother.
"Daisy jumps to one side if even a
piece of paper blows near her."</p>

<p>"He is a good horse," said Farmer
Hill. "He will not run away, but he
is very strong-bitted and will have his
own way sometimes. It would take a
strong arm to hold him back if he
wanted to run fast."</p>

<p>"What is his name?" asked Sue.</p>

<p>"His name is Prince," said father.</p>

<p>"That is a fine name," said Sue.</p>

<p>"I hope Prince will prove to be a
good horse," said mother.</p>

<p>"He has one excellent trait," said
father. "Farmer Ross says he always
knows the way home. His daughter
lost her way once and Prince found the
right road and brought her safely
home."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a wonderful thing!" said
John.</p>

<p>"Now I will put Prince in the stall
next to Daisy's," said father.</p>

<p>He went toward the barn leading
Prince, while John and Bobby followed
along.</p>

<p>When they reached the barn, Farmer
Hill gave Prince a drink from the
watering trough, opened the big door
and led him into the stall.</p>

<p>In the manger were some oats, and
the rack was filled with hay which he
could eat whenever he wished.</p>

<p>So Prince had plenty to eat and a
good stall to stand in. But he was not
happy.</p>

<p>He kept thinking of his old home.</p>

<p>It was not nearly so big a stall as
this and not nearly so fine a barn. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
oats there were no better and the hay
no sweeter. But that had been his
home all his life, so he kept thinking
about it and wishing he were there.</p>

<p>The fact was that Prince was homesick.</p>

<p>"I'll go back there if I get a chance,"
thought Prince, "and live in my old
stall, with the horses in Farmer Ross's
barn."</p>

</div>



<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>


<p>The next day after Prince came to
Cloverfield Farm, Farmer Hill had to
go to the city. He took Bobby with
him and they were gone until afternoon.</p>

<p>All the other horses were out in the
field working. Prince was standing in
his stall, very lonesome.</p>

<p>He was still thinking of his old
home and wishing he could go back
there.</p>

<p>"I'll go back if I get a chance,"
thought Prince.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>After a while mother said to John:
"Prince must be thirsty. Father may
not be back for some time, so I think
you had better let Prince have a
drink."</p>

<p>John opened the stable door and led
him to the watering trough in the barn-yard.</p>

<p>All the while he was drinking, Prince
was wondering how he could get away.</p>

<p>John had hold of the rope but not
very tightly.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Prince gave a jerk and
the rope slipped from John's hand.</p>

<p>Away went Prince, through the
barn-yard gate, up the lane, out the
gravel driveway and down the road.</p>

<p>The rope was dragging along, his
mane was tossing and his heels went
galloping over the dusty road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time Farmer Hill and Bobby
were coming home from the city in the
buggy, and they saw a horse coming
toward them down the road.</p>

<p>"Oh, father, someone's horse is running
away!" said Bobby.</p>

<p>When the horse came near, father
exclaimed: "Why, that is Prince! I
must stop him."</p>

<p>"Whoa, Prince, whoa!" he said.</p>

<p>Prince never stopped but went galloping
past.</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall we do?" asked
Bobby.</p>

<p>"We must go after him," said father.
So he turned Daisy around and they
started after Prince.</p>

<p>"Get-up, Daisy, get-up," he said.
He even took the whip from its socket
and touched Daisy, just ever so lightly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
but enough to let her know she must
go fast.</p>

<p>And so they went down the road,
Prince galloping along and Farmer
Hill following after.</p>

<p>For two miles along a stretch of
level road they went, Prince getting
farther ahead all the time.</p>

<p>"I'll not let him catch me," thought
Prince, "I shall run and run."</p>

<p>Then came a cross road and Prince
turned to the right.</p>

<p>And so they went down this road,
Prince galloping ahead, father and
Bobby following after.</p>

<p>When Prince came to the next corner,
he turned to the left.</p>

<p>Bobby saw him turn. "Prince has
turned onto another road," he said.
"Why doesn't he go straight ahead?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps he wants to go to some
special place," said father.</p>

<p>By the time they reached the corner,
Prince was out of sight around a curve
in the road.</p>

<p>"Do you think Prince will run a
hundred miles?" asked Bobby.</p>

<p>"We shall see," answered father.
"Daisy is getting tired, so we shall
have to go slowly for a while."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Prince will get tired and
stop," said Bobby, "and then we can
catch him."</p>

<p>But Prince had been resting in the
barn all day, and his long slim legs
felt as strong and fresh as when he
started.</p>

<p>No, Prince was not tired, but he
had reached the place where he wanted
to go.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>That white house just beyond
the curve in the road was Farmer
Ross's.</p>

<p>When Prince reached it, he slowed
up, walked through the gate and down
to the barn.</p>

<p>The hired man, when he took the
horses out to work that day, had left
the stable door open.</p>

<p>So Prince walked around to the back
of the barn, through the open door and
into his old stall.</p>

<p>"How nice to be here again,"
thought Prince.</p>

<p>When Farmer Hill and Bobby
reached Mr. Ross's place, Prince was
nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>They drove into the yard. "Why
do we stop here?" asked Bobby. "We
must keep going after Prince."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are going after Prince," said
father.</p>

<p>"But Prince cannot be here," said
Bobby. "He was galloping down the
road."</p>

<p>"I think we shall find him here,"
said father. "This is his old home."</p>

<p>Father and Bobby looked around
the yard, but no Prince was there.</p>

<p>The open stable door was not in
sight.</p>

<p>Just then Farmer Ross came up
from the field. "We are looking for
Prince," said Farmer Hill. "He must
have gotten out of my stable, for we
met him coming this way and followed
after."</p>

<p>"I have not seen him. Let us look
around," said Farmer Ross.</p>

<p>But Prince was nowhere to be seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you sure he came in here?"
asked Farmer Ross.</p>

<p>"Not sure," said Farmer Hill, "but
I think he did. Could he have gone
into the barn?"</p>

<p>They went to the stable door and
looked.</p>

<p>There was Prince standing quietly
in his stall, eating hay from the rack.</p>

<p>"I told you he always remembered
the way home," said Farmer Ross.</p>

<p>"I'll take him back and this time
we'll be more careful with him," said
Farmer Hill.</p>

<p>So again he led Prince home and
put him in the stall beside Daisy.</p>

<p>Every day he fed him plenty of hay
and oats, gave him a good bed of
straw to lie on at night, and always
treated him kindly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>John sometimes gave him a lump
of sugar, but father always led him
out to water and held the halter very
tightly.</p>

<p>After a few weeks Prince liked the
new home so well that he never
wanted to go back to the old one
again.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>


<p>Cloverfield Farm had a big Shepherd
dog named Rover.</p>

<p>One day Rover lay under the apple
tree in the back yard, taking his afternoon
nap. Just over the fence in the
pasture Farmer Hill's cows were grazing.</p>

<p>Suddenly Molly, the Big Red Cow,
came near the stone wall on the farther
side of the pasture. She smelled the
corn in Neighbor Newman's cornfield
beyond the stone wall.</p>

<p>Now if there is one thing that cows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
like better than anything else, it is
growing sweet corn. Molly looked at
it longingly over the stone wall. She
smelled it in the breeze.</p>

<p>Not far away Molly saw a low place
in the wall. Over this she jumped into
the cornfield. All the other cows saw
her and followed&mdash;the White Cow, the
Black Cow, the two Speckled Cows,
and the Little Red Cow.</p>

<p>They all began eating Neighbor
Newman's corn.</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Hill looked over
that way and saw the cows in the
cornfield.</p>

<p>Farmer Hill had gone to town that
day, so he could not get the cows out
of the corn. The hired man was down
in the field by the woods, so he could
not get the cows out of the corn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who will get the cows out of the
corn?" thought Mrs. Hill.</p>

<p>Going to the back door, she
spied Rover taking his afternoon
nap. "Rover, Rover," she called,
"the cows are in the corn." But
Rover only opened one eye a very
little bit and wagged his tail, a
very weeny mite, and went on with
his nap.</p>

<p>Again she called, very loudly, "Rover,
Rover, get the cows out of the corn,
quick! quick!"</p>

<p>Rover understood this time and
jumped to his feet. "Look, there they
are," said Mrs. Hill, pointing to the
cornfield.</p>

<p>When Rover saw what had happened,
he ran just like a flash across
the pasture lot, jumped over the stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
wall and began to bark at the Big Red
Cow.</p>

<p>"Bow-wow, bow-wow," barked Rover,
which meant, "Go back into your
pasture."</p>

<p>But the Big Red Cow only switched
her tail and went on eating corn.</p>

<p>"Bow-wow, bow-wow," barked Rover
again; but still she went on eating
corn, and all the other cows went on
eating corn.</p>

<p>Then Rover bit the leg of the Big
Red Cow. It was only just a little
bite, but she knew it meant, "Get out
of the cornfield or I will bite you very
hard."</p>

<p>The Big Red Cow went to the stone
wall with Rover barking at her heels,
until she jumped back into the pasture
lot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he went to the other cows and
made them all jump back over the
stone wall into the pasture lot&mdash;the
White Cow, the Black Cow, the two
Speckled Cows, and the Little Red
Cow.</p>

<p>Just as the last cow was jumping
over the wall, Farmer Hill came home
along the road from the city. He saw
what Rover had done.</p>

<p>Rover got back to his place under
the apple tree just as Farmer Hill drove
into the yard. "Good dog, good dog,"
said Farmer Hill in a kind voice.</p>

<p>Rover looked up and wagged his
tail.</p>

<p>"Is there a bone for Rover?" said
Farmer Hill. Mrs. Hill went to the
cupboard and found a big bone and
gave it to Rover.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p>"I must have the men fix that hole
in the wall," said Farmer Hill.</p>

<p>When Rover was through with the
bone, he went back to finish his afternoon
nap under the apple tree.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do to-day?"
asked Bobby one morning.</p>

<p>Father looked across the table with
a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"Prince and Daisy and I are going
to help make bread to-day, Bobby,"
said he.</p>

<p>"Why, father," said Bobby, "you
cannot make bread and horses cannot
make bread."</p>

<p>"I did not say we were going to
make it alone," said father. "I said
we were going to help."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother makes the bread. She
makes it in the kitchen," said Bobby.</p>

<p>"But we are going to help," said
father.</p>

<p>"Can Prince and Daisy come into
the kitchen?" asked Bobby.</p>

<p>"No, they will not come into the
kitchen," said father. "They truly will
help, though. Would you like to see
them?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bobby. "That would
be fun."</p>

<p>"Come down to the field below the
barn with me," said father.</p>

<p>So Bobby ran along beside father
down the lane to the Old Red Barn.</p>

<p>Father harnessed Prince and Daisy,
drove them to the field below the barn
and hitched them to a tool with a
shiny steel point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, father, that is a plow," said
Bobby. "Mother does not make
bread with a plow. She makes it
in a pan and stirs it with a big
spoon."</p>

<p>"That is true," said father, "but
we shall help to make bread with a
plow."</p>

<p>Soon father started the horses while
he held the handles of the plow so its
shiny steel point would dig down into
the hard earth.</p>

<p>Straight to the other end of the field
they went, leaving behind them a long
furrow of brown fresh earth.</p>

<p>Back they came toward Bobby,
making another furrow. And so back
and forth, back and forth, all the forenoon
they went.</p>

<p>Bobby sometimes trudged along by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
father, sometimes he rested at the end
of the field.</p>

<p>Bobby was watching very hard. At
last he said, "Father, there is not any
bread yet. When shall I see the bread?"</p>

<p>"It takes a long time to make bread
from this brown earth," said father.</p>

<p>"Does it take all day?" said Bobby,
who was beginning to get tired.</p>

<p>"Yes, it takes more than a day,"
said father. "It takes about a year."</p>

<p>"I think mother's way is better,"
said Bobby. "It takes her only one
day."</p>

<p>"But mother could not make bread
at all, if we did not help," said father.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed, she does," said Bobby.
"I have seen her make it all alone."</p>

<p>"Bobby," said father, "of what does
mother make our bread?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Bobby was only six years old,
but he had often watched mother make
bread.</p>

<p>"She makes it from flour," said he.</p>

<p>"What is the flour made from?"
asked father.</p>

<p>"The miller grinds it from wheat,"
said Bobby.</p>

<p>"And where does the wheat come
from?" asked father.</p>

<p>"It grows in the field," said Bobby.</p>

<p>"So far you are right, Bobby," said
father. "Now look at the ground over
there where I have not yet plowed.
Would wheat grow if I sowed it
there?"</p>

<p>"I suppose not," said Bobby.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said father. "It
would lie on top of the ground and
wither and die; but when I sow it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the soft earth which Prince and Daisy
have plowed, it will grow."</p>

<p>"Now I see," said Bobby, "Prince
and Daisy do truly help to make
bread."</p>

<p>"You are good horses," said he, patting
them on their noses.</p>

<p>Just then the dinner bell rang.</p>

<p>"Come, Bobby," said father. "We
will take Prince and Daisy to the barn
and give them hay and oats. Then
you and I will go up to the house and
eat some of mother's nice bread."</p>

<p>"Oh, father," said Bobby, "you forgot.
It is Prince and Daisy's bread
too."</p>

<p>Down on Cloverfield Farm the afternoon
sun was sinking toward the West.</p>

<p>The swallows were coming home to
their nests in the barn and a gentle
breeze was starting the windmill.</p>

<p>Farmer Hill looked at his watch;
then he went to the bars at the head
of the long lane and began putting
them down.</p>

<p>Rover, seeing this, came running up
to him. "Yes, Rover," said Farmer
Hill, "it is time to go for the cows."</p>

<p>Down the long lane trotted Rover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
past the apple orchard, past the clover
field, past the field of wheat stubble,
to the thirteen-acre lot.</p>

<p>In the farthest corner of the field,
with her feet in the cool water of the
pond, was the Big Red Cow. Near-by,
under the elm trees, were all the other
cows lying on the grass.</p>

<p>Straight to the Big Red Cow ran
Rover and barked. The cow knew
what that meant. It said, "You must
go home to the barn." So she started
toward the lane.</p>

<p>Then all the other cows followed.</p>

<p>Rover came trotting along behind,
barking sometimes if they tried to turn
back.</p>

<p>So they all went up the long, long
lane toward the old red barn&mdash;the Big
Red Cow, the White Cow, the Black
Cow, the two Speckled Cows and the
Little Red Cow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;You must go home to the barn&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>
<p>Past the field of wheat stubble, past
the clover field, and along the orchard
fence, they went.</p>

<p>As they came near the harvest apple
tree, the Big Red Cow smelled the
apples. Now next to fresh green corn,
cows like apples better than anything
else. So the Big Red Cow tried to
jump over the rail fence, to get some
apples.</p>

<p>She might have gotten over; but
Rover ran up to her and barked
and snapped at her heels with his
sharp teeth, until she started on
again.</p>

<p>So all the cows went up the lane and
through the bars into the barn-yard.
They drank the cool water in the watering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
trough and then went into their
stalls in the stable.</p>

<p>Farmer Hill turned to Rover and
said, "Good dog, good dog!"</p>

<p>Rover wagged his tail very hard.
He liked to bring the cows from pasture.</p>

<p>Then he went to the windmill to
wait till the children should come with
their tin cups to drink the nice warm
milk at milking time.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI</h2>


<p>Mrs. Plymouth Rock lived in the
chicken coop out by the wood-pile with
her brood of eleven chicks. There were
black chicks and yellow chicks, but the
nicest of all was Little Yellow Chick.</p>

<p>Mother Hen always stayed in the
coop.</p>

<p>The little chicks would jump out
between the slats and go off through
the grass and into the driveway and
among the chips of the wood-pile.</p>

<p>When Mother Hen wanted them to
come home she would call, "Cluck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
cluck, cluck, cluck!" and all the little
chicks would come running to the
coop.</p>

<p>One hot summer afternoon, Mrs.
Hill was sitting on the back porch
mending stockings. All the big hens
were scattered around the place&mdash;some
in the garden, some in the cornfield,
some in the farmyard&mdash;scratching for
bugs and worms.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a great cackling
and scurrying among the fowls. Those
in the garden ran and cackled, those
in the cornfield ran and cackled, those
in the farmyard ran and cackled.
They all ran as fast as they could to
the hen house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill, hearing the commotion,
stood up and looked around to see
what was the matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>There in the sky coming toward the
farmyard, was a large gray hen hawk.</p>

<p>Old Mother Hen heard the cries of
the other fowls and knew there was
danger, so she called her chicks to
come home. "Cluck, cluck, cluck,
cluck!" went Mother Hen.</p>

<p>All the little chicks tried to run home
to the chicken coop. They ran as fast
as their little short legs could carry
them.</p>

<p>Little Yellow Chick could not run
fast. He tried very hard, but stumbled
over a chip near the wood-pile.</p>

<p>The hawk up in the sky with his
sharp eye saw Little Yellow Chick and
flew straight toward him.</p>

<p>Old Mother Hen could not help Little
Yellow Chick, for she could not get
out of the coop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<p>Mrs. Hill ran toward him, but she
could not help him for she could not
run fast enough.</p>

<p>But Rover, lying under the pine
tree in the front yard, heard the commotion
and came running like the wind
past Mrs. Hill.</p>

<p>He jumped at the fierce hawk and
snapped at him with his sharp white
teeth, just as the hawk was swooping
to pick up Little Yellow Chick.</p>

<p>When Mr. Hawk heard the barking
and saw Rover dash towards him he
forgot about wanting to eat Little Yellow
Chick and flew away as fast as he
could.</p>

<p>He flew up into the sky and over
the woods and far away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill picked up Little Yellow
Chick and carried him to Old Mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Hen in the coop. Old Mother Hen
took him safely under her wing.</p>

<p>"Good dog, good dog!" said Mrs.
Hill to Rover as she patted his neck.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill went back to mending
stockings on the porch.</p>

<p>But Rover lay down near the hen-coop
to guard Little Yellow Chick.</p>

<p>The Big City was ten miles from
Cloverfield Farm. Farmer Hill had
to go there often on business. Mrs.
Hill had to go there to buy shoes and
clothing. Sometimes they drove, but
if they were in a hurry they went to
the village a mile away and took the
train.</p>

<p>"I must go to the city to-day to
attend to some important business,"
said father one morning. "It will not
take long, so I will go down on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
nine o'clock train and back on the
eleven."</p>

<p>"Are you going to drive to the train
or walk?" asked mother. "I need some
groceries before dinner and wish you
would drive so you could bring them
back."</p>

<p>"I will drive then," said father. "I
meant to walk."</p>

<p>Mother wrote down a long list of
groceries&mdash;flour, sugar, tea, raisins,
molasses, rolled oats and spices.</p>

<p>"I will leave the list with Mr.
Brown," said father, "so he will have
them ready for me when I come back
and I won't have to wait."</p>

<p>So father drove Prince to the
village and tied him to the hitching
post in front of Mr. Brown's
store.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>He gave the list to the grocer.</p>

<p>"Please have them ready when I
come back on the eleven o'clock train,"
said he.</p>

<p>Then father went to his train.</p>

<p>The grocer put up the order. "I
might as well put them in the buggy
for him now," said he.</p>

<p>So he carried the groceries out and
packed them under the seat.</p>

<p>Farmer Hill intended to come back
on the eleven o'clock train; but his
business took him longer than he expected,
so he could not come until the
next train at one o'clock.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Prince stood very still
and patient for some time. Then he
began to take a few steps forward once
in a while, and then a few steps backward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince liked to go. He did not like
to stand still so long.</p>

<p>Every time he stepped back and
forth, the knot in the halter loosened
a little. After a while, about one
o'clock, it became entirely untied.</p>

<p>When father got off the train, he
was still thinking of his business in
the city and was in a hurry to get home.
So he never once thought about Prince,
but struck off across lots and hurried
home afoot.</p>

<p>"Where are Prince and the groceries?"
asked mother, as father came into
the house.</p>

<p>"Prince and the groceries?" said he,
"Prince and the groceries? Sure
enough, I did drive Prince down this
morning. I entirely forgot him. He
must be standing at the hitching post<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
in front of the store. I'll go back and
get him."</p>

<p>Before this time Prince was quite
hungry. He was very tired standing
still so long. He wished he could go
home to his stall and eat his dinner.</p>

<p>Still Farmer Hill did not come for
him.</p>

<p>The next time he stepped forward,
there was no halter to stop him; so he
kept on walking down the street.</p>

<p>The thought of home and his dinner
made him want them very much.</p>

<p>So he began to trot.</p>

<p>Just as Farmer Hill was leaving the
house to go after him, Prince turned
into the yard.</p>

<p>"There is Prince now," said father.
"He has come home alone."</p>

<p>"But I need the groceries," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
mother. "I must have the sugar right
away. One of us will have to drive
back after them."</p>

<p>"Sure enough," said father, "I'll go
because I am the one who forgot
them."</p>

<p>He started to get into the buggy.</p>

<p>"Why, here are the groceries," said
he. "Prince has brought them home."</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>


<p>On Sundays at Cloverfield Farm
Rover always stayed at home to guard
the place while the family went to
church.</p>

<p>Just once, a long time ago, he had
followed clear to the church door,
when Mr. Hill had sent him back
home.</p>

<p>One Sunday in summer, father
hitched the horses to the big carriage
and drove up to the horse block where
mother and the children were waiting
for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you lock all the doors?" asked
father.</p>

<p>"Yes," said mother, "and all the
windows too."</p>

<p>"Where is Rover?" asked father.</p>

<p>"He is under the apple tree," said
John.</p>

<p>Then they got into the carriage and
drove to church&mdash;father, John and Sue
on the front seat; mother, Bobby and
Baby Betty on the back seat.</p>

<p>Past two farm houses, under the
Big Trees, past two more farm houses,
down the little hill and through the
village they went to the big stone
church on the brow of the big
hill.</p>

<p>After father had driven the horses
and carriage under the shed at the
rear of the church, all the family went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
into church and up the middle aisle
to their pew near the front.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at the farm Rover was
having a good nap under the apple
tree.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was awakened by the
sound of wheels on the gravel drive.
Up he jumped and ran up the driveway
to welcome the family home.</p>

<p>But what was his surprise to see a
strange horse and carriage and strange
people in the carriage!</p>

<p>"Strangers must not come into this
yard when the folks are away,"
thought Rover. So he ran toward
them, growling and barking.</p>

<p>"Bow-wow, bow-wow," barked Rover,
"bow-wow-wow, gr-r-r-"</p>

<p>"Hello, Rover," said a man's
voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 427px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why, I have heard that voice before,"
thought Rover.</p>

<p>Then he ran nearer and saw that
the man was Uncle James and the lady
beside him was Aunt Polly.</p>

<p>Rover stopped barking and growling
and wagged his tail very hard
and looked pleased, for he liked
them.</p>

<p>Uncle James got out of the carriage
and went to the front door.</p>

<p>He rang the bell and waited a few
moments, but nobody came. He rang
it again, but nobody came.</p>

<p>"I thought somebody always stayed
at home with Baby Betty," said Uncle
James.</p>

<p>"Perhaps some one is in the garden
or out in the orchard," said Aunt
Polly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle James hitched the horse, and
then they looked in the garden and in
the orchard, but could find nobody.</p>

<p>"Where are all the folks?" asked
Aunt Polly of Rover.</p>

<p>"Find Bobby and Baby Betty," said
Uncle James.</p>

<p>Rover pricked up his ears and
opened his eyes very wide. He looked
from Uncle James to Aunt Polly.</p>

<p>"Go find Baby Betty," said Aunt
Polly.</p>

<p>Then Uncle James and Aunt Polly
went to the front porch and sat in the
big rockers.</p>

<p>Rover started down the road toward
the church. He trotted along
quite fast past the two farm houses,
under the Big Trees, past two more
farm houses, down the little hill and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
through the village to the big stone
church on the brow of the big hill.</p>

<p>The front door was open, so he
went through the vestibule into the
big room where the minister was
preaching.</p>

<p>"Bow-wow, bow-wow," barked
Rover.</p>

<p>Farmer Hill looked around quickly,
for he knew Rover's voice.</p>

<p>When Rover saw Farmer Hill's face,
he ran up the middle aisle to the pew
where the Hill family sat.</p>

<p>When they heard a dog bark in
church, some of the boys snickered
and some of the girls laughed and
some of the older people smiled, but
Farmer Hill put his hand on Rover's
head and said very softly, "Lie down,
Rover."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>So he lay down in the aisle with his
head resting on his front paws and
kept very still all through the service.</p>

<p>When meeting was over, the minister
came to Rover and patted him
and said, "You behaved nicely in
church, Rover."</p>

<p>As they were driving home, John
said, "I wonder why Rover came to
church."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he was lonesome at
home alone," said mother.</p>

<p>"Perhaps something is the matter
there," said father.</p>

<p>As they came into the yard, Sue
was the first to see the visitors.</p>

<p>"Why, there are Uncle James and
Aunt Polly," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Didn't Rover tell you that we
were here?" asked Uncle James.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"So that is why he came to
church, is it?" said mother.</p>

<p>"Rover is an intelligent dog,"
said father.</p>

<p>Rover looked from one to another
and lay down on the porch where
they were all visiting together.</p>

<p>It was the middle of winter and
Cloverfield Farm was deep under
snow. The ponds were all frozen
over and even the little brook had
stopped babbling and was frozen
into silvery ice.</p>

<p>Bobby liked the winter, because
he could coast on the Little Hill and
take rides in the big bob-sleigh.</p>

<p>There was no work to be done on
the farm in winter; so Prince and
Daisy stood all day in their stalls
in the Old Red Barn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"How would you like a long
sleigh ride to-day, Bobby?" asked
father one morning.</p>

<p>"I'm ready for one; that would
be great fun. Where are you going?"
answered Bobby.</p>

<p>"Well, harvest time has come,"
said father. "So Prince and Daisy
and I are going to help harvest
butter and ice cream."</p>

<p>"This is not harvest time," said
Bobby; "harvest time is in the summer
when it is very hot. And besides,
Prince and Daisy cannot make
butter and ice cream. Mother makes
the butter, and John freezes the ice
cream."</p>

<p>"Do you remember, Bobby, how
they helped make bread?" asked
father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Bobby.</p>

<p>"If you will come with me, I will
show you how they <i>do truly</i> help to
make butter and ice cream too," said
father.</p>

<p>"Shall I have to go far, father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is quite a long drive.
Ask mother to bundle you up
warm," said father.</p>

<p>Before long, father was at the
door with the big bob-sleigh drawn
by Prince and Daisy. He tucked
Bobby in warm and snug with
the buffalo robe, and then away
they went. The bells on the
horses jingled merrily as they
went skimming along over the
snow.</p>

<p>"Are we going to the city?" asked
Bobby.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Bobby, not this time. We
are going to the river," said father.</p>

<p>"I never saw any ice cream in the
river," said Bobby.</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes wide open, Bobby,
and you will see Prince and Daisy
help get ice cream from the river,"
said father.</p>

<p>When they came to the river,
Bobby could see that it was all one
mass of ice. Men working there
had swept the snow off and were
cutting the ice into great blocks.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Bobby, "this is where
we get the ice for John to put in the
freezer."</p>

<p>Father drove close down to the
edge of the river and the men filled
the sleigh with a great load of the
big blocks of ice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"May I have a dish of the ice
cream to-day?" asked Bobby.</p>

<p>"Not to-day," said father, "not
until summer."</p>

<p>They were on the way home now,
the horses going slowly with the
heavy load.</p>

<p>"But it will not be summer for
a long time," said Bobby. "By
that time the snow and ice will all
melt."</p>

<p>"This ice will not melt," said
father, "even when spring comes
and the snow goes off."</p>

<p>"That is strange," said Bobby.
"Truly I am afraid it will melt
and then we shall have no ice
cream."</p>

<p>"Just watch," said father, "and
see where I put it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>When they reached home father
drove to the ice house.</p>

<p>"Look in there," he said to
Bobby, "and tell me what you
see."</p>

<p>"I see a great pile of sawdust,"
said Bobby. "You won't put the
ice in there will you, father? I
do not want sawdust in my ice
cream."</p>

<p>"We will see that no sawdust gets
into the ice cream," said father,
"and yet we could not make the
ice cream without it."</p>

<p>Father carried the big cakes of
ice into the ice house and piled them
in rows on a deep layer of sawdust.
Then he went for another load and
another and another. All that week
he kept drawing ice until the ice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
house was nearly full. Over the
top of the ice and around the sides
of it he packed sawdust until it
looked like a mountain.</p>

<p>"Are you trying to keep the ice
warm?" asked Bobby.</p>

<p>"No, Bobby, I am covering it with
the sawdust to keep it cool," said
father.</p>

<p>"That is very strange," said
Bobby. "Mother puts blankets on
me to keep me warm. You put a
blanket on the ice to keep it cool.
I think there must be a mistake
somewhere."</p>

<p>After a few months spring came
and the snow melted and the ice
on the river melted.</p>

<p>One day mother said, "If you will
get me some ice we will have ice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
cream to-day. I am going to churn
too and will need some for the
butter."</p>

<p>"I am afraid the ice is all melted,
mother," said Bobby.</p>

<p>"Come with me and we will see,"
said father.</p>

<p>So they went to the ice house.
Father climbed on top of the mountain
of sawdust. Bobby climbed after
him.</p>

<p>Father dug some of the sawdust
off, then said, "Now you may dig,
Bobby."</p>

<p>Bobby began to scoop the sawdust
off. Pretty soon his hand touched
something cold. He dug some more
and then came to a piece of shiny
silvery ice.</p>

<p>Father lifted it out. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
a large cake of glittering ice just as
they had put it in last winter.</p>

<p>"Now we'll wash the sawdust off,"
said father.</p>

<p>So they stopped at the well and
washed it all clean, and then broke
it into pieces. Part of it they took
to mother to keep the butter cool;
part of it to John to freeze the ice
cream.</p>

<p>When the ice cream was frozen
and Bobby was eating a dish of it,
father said, "Well, Bobby, who
made the ice cream to-day?"</p>

<p>"I see now," said Bobby. "We
could not have had it on this hot
day if Prince and Daisy had not
drawn the heavy loads of ice last
winter."</p>

<p>"And I could not have made such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
good butter without the ice," said
mother.</p>

<p>"If horses liked ice cream," said
Bobby, "I would give some of mine
to Daisy and Prince."</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X</h2>


<p>This is a story about Prince when
he was naughty. It was one time
when Farmer Hill let him out into
the pasture for a day and Prince
would not come back at night.</p>

<p>It began when Farmer Hill said
one Sunday morning in spring, "I
will turn Prince and Daisy into the
pasture to-day and let the other
horses take us to church."</p>

<p>All winter long Prince had been in
his stall in the barn, except once in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
a while when he had been driven to
the village or the city.</p>

<p>He had been standing in the dark
stall so long that when Farmer Hill
turned him loose in the pasture, he
felt very strange.</p>

<p>At first he just stood near the
bars and nibbled the short fresh
grass. Then he slowly walked
around to the clump of trees in the
middle of the lot and ate some more
grass; then he went to the far corner
and took a drink of cool water from
the little brook.</p>

<p>The sun was shining brightly,
the birds were singing in the trees.
Prince liked the bright sunlight, he
liked the gentle breeze, he liked the
fresh grass.</p>

<p>"I shall stay here always," thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Prince. "I should like to run and
kick up my heels."</p>

<p>So he kicked up his heels and ran
to the other end of the field.</p>

<p>After a while he went galloping
back again.</p>

<p>All day Prince and Daisy were out
in the pasture, sometimes eating
grass, sometimes resting under the
trees, sometimes running and prancing
around.</p>

<p>Toward night, when it was time
for them to go back into the stable,
Farmer Hill came to the bars
and whistled.</p>

<p>They both heard him whistle.</p>

<p>Daisy came running toward him,
and he opened the stable door and
put her in.</p>

<p>But Prince did not come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead, he turned and ran to the
other end of the field.</p>

<p>"I shall not go into the stable tonight,"
thought Prince. "I shall
stay here always."</p>

<p>"He acts as frisky as a young
colt," said father. "I shall have to
put a halter on and lead him."</p>

<p>So he took the halter from its peg
near the stable door, and walked
toward Prince.</p>

<p>Farmer Hill had almost reached
Prince, who had been standing quite
still, when suddenly Prince kicked
up his heels, gave his mane a toss
and was off like the wind.</p>

<p>"Whoa, Prince," said Farmer Hill.</p>

<p>Prince did not stop until he reached
the other end of the field near the
barn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Farmer Hill came back toward
him, and once more Prince stood
still until he was almost there and
then bounded off.</p>

<p>"It is like a game of tag," said
Bobby, who had been watching by
the bars. "You never can catch
him, father."</p>

<p>"I will fool him," said father. "I
shall catch him then."</p>

<p>"How will you do it?" asked Bobby.</p>

<p>"Just watch, Bobby, and you will
see," said father.</p>

<p>Father got a measure of oats from
the granary and walked toward
Prince, holding it out to him.</p>

<p>When Prince saw the measure of
oats, he wanted some to eat.</p>

<p>After a while he started to walk up
to the measure. Then he stopped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will not go near him," thought
Prince. "I will stay out in the pasture."</p>

<p>But the more he thought about
the oats, the more he wanted them.
After a while a bright idea came
to him.</p>

<p>"I will go and take one bite,"
thought Prince, "and then I will
run away quickly."</p>

<p>So he walked slowly up to Farmer
Hill.</p>

<p>Farmer Hill let him put his head
into the measure.</p>

<p>Prince took one bite. That tasted
so good that he took another and
another until the oats were all
eaten. While he was eating, Farmer
Hill slipped the halter around his
neck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he tried to get away, but
the halter held him tight.</p>

<p>"I have you now," said Farmer
Hill. "You must come into the
stable."</p>

<p>As father led him to the stable,
Bobby said, "Prince was naughty
that time, wasn't he, father?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said father, "he led me
a merry chase, but I cannot blame
him much. Who would not rather
be outdoors on a day like this than
in the finest stable, or house either?"</p>

<p>"I think Prince was sensible,"
said Bobby.</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI</h2>


<p>Cloverfield Farmhouse had a new
looking glass. It was a very large
looking glass, reaching to the ceiling
and almost down to the floor.
It was in the parlor between the
front windows. On the little shelf
under it were two beautiful vases.</p>

<p>Rover was not allowed in the
parlor except once in a while. One
Sunday John let him come in and
lie in the corner.</p>

<p>After a while all the people went
out of the parlor. Rover was there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
alone fast asleep. When he wakened,
he looked all around the room.</p>

<p>Then he got up and walked
around to find a door.</p>

<p>There between the front windows
was surely a door into another
room.</p>

<p>Rover saw himself in the looking
glass, but thought it was another dog
coming toward him into the parlor.</p>

<p>He began to bark at the other dog.
But the other dog did not go away.
He even barked at Rover.</p>

<p>Rover went nearer and the other
dog came nearer too.</p>

<p>Then Rover barked louder and
showed his sharp white teeth. The
other dog showed his sharp white
teeth too, but did not go away.</p>

<p>Rover barked and barked, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
meant, "You must get right out
of this house." Then he ran at
the other dog very fast.</p>

<p>He ran so fast that he bumped his
head hard on the looking glass. He
knocked over one of the pretty vases
and broke it into a hundred pieces.</p>

<p>Mother and Sue heard the crash.
Father and John heard the crash.
They all came running into the parlor.</p>

<p>There, among the broken pieces
of the vase, was Rover still looking
savagely at the dog in the looking
glass.</p>

<p>John pulled him away from the
glass. Mother said, "Bad dog,
bad dog!" Sister Sue scolded him
and opened the door and put him
outdoors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<p>"Rover was fooled that time,"
said father.</p>

<p>"We must not allow him in the
parlor again," said mother.</p>

<p>Rover knew he must have done
something wrong. With his head
down and his tail hanging very
limp he went to the horse barn to
lie in the dark corner and think
it over.</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII</h2>


<p>"Where is Baby Betty?" said
mother, coming up from the cellar
where she had been making butter.</p>

<p>"I saw Baby Betty's pink sunbonnet
in the front yard by the
maple tree an hour ago," said big
brother John. Then he ran to the
front yard and looked everywhere&mdash;behind
the maple tree, under the
lilac bush, down by the road, but
no Baby Betty was there.</p>

<p>"I saw Baby Betty down by the
pump not long ago," said father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Then they looked by the well, and
in the corn crib and all through
the farmyard, but no Baby Betty
was there.</p>

<p>"I saw Baby Betty's curly head
in the garden a while ago," said
big sister Sue. Then Sue ran to
the garden and looked under the
currant bushes, behind the asparagus
bed and in the strawberry patch.</p>

<p>But no Baby Betty was there.</p>

<p>"Where, oh, where is Baby Betty?"
said mother. Then they all
looked, down the lane, in the apple
orchard, in the clover field and behind
the haystack, but no Baby
Betty could be found.</p>

<p>Just then Rover came home from
the village with the hired man.
"Where is Baby Betty?" said father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
"Find Baby Betty." Then he
showed Rover Betty's little pink
sunbonnet. Rover smelled of it
and looked around the yard and
whined. First he ran to the front
yard and then to the pump, then
to the garden and then to the
strawberry patch beyond the garden.</p>

<p>"He thinks she is in the strawberry
patch," said Sue, "but I
looked there and I surely would
have seen her."</p>

<p>Up and down the rows went
Rover, and across to the farther
side of the patch. Soon he stopped
and barked a little and then came
running back.</p>

<p>Again he started over to the
strawberry patch. "I believe he
wants us to follow," said mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Then all of them followed Rover
away to the farther side of the
strawberry patch.</p>

<p>There, behind a clump of tall
plants, with her hand clutching
some ripe berries, was Baby Betty
fast asleep.</p>

<p>Father lifted her and carried her
to the house. Mother came close
along by his side; while John and
Sue patted Rover's neck and said,
"Good dog, good dog."</p>

<p>Rover looked up at them with his
kind eyes and wagged his tail very
hard.</p>

<p>Baby Betty went to playing again
in the yard, and Rover lay down
under the apple tree to watch over
her.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII</h2>


<p>"May I have a horse to drive
to town this afternoon?" asked
mother one noon in summer. "I
must take Bobby and Betty to get
them some new shoes."</p>

<p>"Yes," said father. "You may
have Prince to-day. He is our
safest horse."</p>

<p>So Sue stayed at home to get supper,
while mother and Bobby and
Betty went away in the carriage
toward the city.</p>

<p>The city was ten miles away. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
was a pleasant drive, past the
little red school house, past farmhouses
and orchards and cornfields
and woods.</p>

<p>When about half way there,
down the road in front of them
there appeared a big threshing
machine, with its engine drawing
it along.</p>

<p>"Chug-chug-chug-chug," went the
engine. Slowly it came toward them.</p>

<p>"Do you think Prince will be
scared?" asked Bobby.</p>

<p>"I hope not," said mother, "but
you had better take fast hold of
Baby Betty so she will not tumble
off the seat if he jumps."</p>

<p>"Chug-chug-chug-chug," slowly
came the engine.</p>

<p>Prince pricked up his ears.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whoa, Prince," said Mrs. Hill,
"steady, Prince."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of that," thought
Prince. "I have seen that thing
before. It makes a lot of noise,
but it never hurts me."</p>

<p>So he went along steady and easy
past the threshing machine.</p>

<p>After a while they came to a
railroad crossing.</p>

<p>"I will look down the track and
you look up the track," said mother
to Bobby.</p>

<p>"I see a train coming," said
Bobby.</p>

<p>"We will wait until it goes past
before we try to cross," said mother
"Whoa, Prince."</p>

<p>So Prince stood facing the track.</p>

<p>On came the train, very fast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
"Chug, chug, chug," went the engine.
"Toot, toot," went the whistle.
"Ding, dong, ding, dong,"
went the bell. Soon the train
went whizzing past.</p>

<p>Prince did not jump. He just
stood still and looked at the train
as it passed. You see, he had seen
trains many times before.</p>

<p>When the train had passed, Mrs.
Hill drove over the track and on
to town.</p>

<p>After she had bought the new
shoes for Bobby and Betty, they
started home again.</p>

<p>Just as they were going down
Main Street, along came a parade
with a brass band at its head.
"We will stop here and see the
parade," said mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>When the band came near them
it played very loud. The drums
were beating, "rub-a-dub-dub, rub-a-dub."
The horns and the fifes and
the flutes and the drums, all made
a beautiful big sound.</p>

<p>Prince pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>"I have heard something like
that before," thought he. "It never
did me any harm."</p>

<p>So he stood very still as the band
went past.</p>

<p>After the parade had gone by,
they started toward home.</p>

<p>"Prince seems not to be afraid
of anything," said mother.</p>

<p>As they drove along, Bobby
was silent for a long time.</p>

<p>At last he said, "I know what
this is like, mother."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it like?" asked mother.</p>

<p>"To market, to market, to buy
a fat pig. Home again, home
again, jiggity jig."</p>

<p>"Only this time," said mother,
"it is, To market, to market, to
buy some new shoes. Home again,
home again, what is the news?"</p>

<p>It was almost dark by the time they
passed the little red school house.</p>

<p>Suddenly in the road ahead there
appeared a strange object, coming
straight toward them. It sounded
something like a steam engine.
"Chug, chug, chug, chug," it went.</p>

<p>In its face were two great glaring
eyes.</p>

<p>"I never saw one of those before,"
thought Prince, "but I shall not
jump."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 422px;">
<img src="images/image095.jpg" width="422" height="580" alt="&quot;&#39;Whoa, Prince, steady, Prince,&#39; said she&quot;" title="&quot;&#39;Whoa, Prince, steady, Prince,&#39; said she&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;Whoa, Prince, steady, Prince,&#39; said she&quot;</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>On it came toward them very
fast.</p>

<p>Just as it was almost there, it
went "honk! honk! honk!"</p>

<p>Prince pricked up his ears.
Mother held tight to the reins.
"Whoa, Prince; steady, Prince,"
she said.</p>

<p>Prince did not mean to jump,
but he had never seen anything
like that before and he was just a
little scared. Just then the strange
thing went "honk, honk," close to
his ears, as it went whizzing past.</p>

<p>Before they had time to think,
jump went Prince to one side,
which made Baby Betty slide off
from the seat.</p>

<p>"What was that?" asked Bobby.</p>

<p>But mother did not answer, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Prince was pulling hard on the lines
and going along very fast.</p>

<p>"It must have been a dragon,"
thought Bobby.</p>

<p>Though mother pulled on the
reins as hard as she could, Prince
did not slow up, for he was a
strong-bitted horse and did not
mind mother's pulling. He went
fast all the way home.</p>

<p>When he reached home, Prince
just slowed up of his own accord
and went trotting slowly into the
yard.</p>

<p>Father was waiting by the horse-block
to help them out.</p>

<p>"What fine new shoes!" he said.
"What is the news?"</p>

<p>"Prince jumped and ran when
he saw the dragon," said Bobby.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"The dragon?" said father. "Did
you see a dragon?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bobby, "and it hissed
and sputtered and went 'squawk,
squawk,' very loud and had two
great big eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh, that must have been one
of those horseless carriages," said
father.</p>

<p>Bobby shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure it was a dragon,"
said he. "Prince thought so
too."</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>


<p>It was a cold winter's night at
Cloverfield Farm. Outdoors the
snow lay deep on the ground.
The cows and the horses were
warm in the Old Red Barn. The
hens and chickens were safe in the
warm hen house. The pigs were
snug and warm in the pig pen.</p>

<p>Inside the house a big fire was
burning merrily in the sitting-room
stove. A fire was burning
in the kitchen range.</p>

<p>All the family had gone to bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Rover had been allowed to sleep
in the kitchen that night instead
of in the cold wood shed.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night the
wind blew hard and made the
kitchen fire roar up the chimney.
It became hot&mdash;so hot that the
wood around the chimney began
to smoke and burn.</p>

<p>All the family were asleep upstairs.
They did not smell the
smoke. They could not see the
flames.</p>

<p>But Rover was awakened by
the smell of smoke and the crackling
of the fire. The smoke made
his eyes smart. He knew that
something was wrong, so he began
to bark.</p>

<p>But nobody heard him and nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
came. Then he ran into
the dining-room and barked, but
nobody heard him and nobody
came.</p>

<p>He went to the door of the hall
which had been left open just a
little. Up the stairs, barking and
barking, went Rover.</p>

<p>Farmer Hill heard him, and
thought, "What is Rover barking
for?" Mrs. Hill heard him and
said, "Something must be the matter.
Let's go and see." John
heard him and jumped up and
ran down stairs. Farmer Hill and
Mrs. Hill ran down stairs.</p>

<p>Then they smelled the smoke and
saw the fire.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill grabbed a pail of
water and threw it on the fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Hill went to the cistern pump
and pumped a pail of water and threw
it on the fire.</p>

<p>John ran out to the well and
brought a pail of water and threw
it on the fire. Sue brought snow
and put it on the fire.</p>

<p>All together they worked, and
soon the fire stopped blazing and
went out.</p>

<p>"If it had not been for Rover, the
house might have burned down,"
said Farmer Hill.</p>

<p>"Rover is a good dog," said Mrs.
Hill as she patted him.</p>

<p>"Good dog, good dog!" said John
and Sue.</p>

<p>They gave Rover a nice warm
blanket to lie on, and fixed the
stove so it could not draw so hard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the family went back to
sleep.</p>

<p>Rover lay down on the blanket,
but he did not go to sleep.</p>

<p>All that night he kept watch.</p>

<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV</h2>


<p>One day in summer Farmer Hill
said at breakfast, "I must go to
the city to-day. There are many
things to do, but I'll be back before
dark."</p>

<p>Then he hitched Prince to the
carriage and started off along the
road, down a long hill, over the
little bridge at the foot of it, along
miles of level road to the city.</p>

<p>All day he was going about his
errands, while Prince stood in a
stable and ate his dinner and rested.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>Toward night, just as Farmer
Hill was going to start home, a
thunder storm came up. It thundered
and lightened and rained
and rained.</p>

<p>It rained so hard that the water
ran in the street like a river.</p>

<p>Farmer Hill waited until the
storm was over. By that time it
was nearly dark.</p>

<p>There were no street lamps along
the road.</p>

<p>There was no moon in the
sky.</p>

<p>There were no stars in the sky.</p>

<p>It became so dark that Farmer
Hill could not see more than three
feet ahead.</p>

<p>"I shall have to let Prince see
for me," said he.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince trotted along over the
muddy road, now and then slowing
up when he came to a pool of
water, now and then turning out
when they met another team.</p>

<p>Finally they had come back as far
as the foot of the hill where the
little bridge was.</p>

<p>"Now I shall soon be home,"
thought Farmer Hill.</p>

<p>Just then Prince stopped stock
still.</p>

<p>"Get-up," said Farmer Hill.
Prince did not go. "What is the
matter?" thought Farmer Hill.</p>

<p>He tried to look in front along
the road, but could see nothing.</p>

<p>Just then a flash of lightning
came and lighted up the country
around for a moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;Why! the bridge is gone!&#39; said Farmer Hill&quot;</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why! the bridge is gone!" said
Farmer Hill.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the heavy rain had
made the creek so high that it had
swept away the little bridge.</p>

<p>"If your eyes had not been
better than mine," said he to
Prince, "we should have been thrown
into the water."</p>

<p>Then he turned Prince around
and went back along the road to
the corner and took another road
home.</p>

<p>At last, very late in the evening,
they came to the farm.</p>

<p>"I am glad to be at home at
last," thought Farmer Hill, as
Prince turned in at the driveway.</p>

<p>Again Prince stopped.</p>

<p>"What is the matter now?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
thought Farmer Hill. "Surely, there
is no bridge gone here."</p>

<p>"Get-up," he said to Prince.
But Prince did not go ahead; instead
he backed.</p>

<p>It was so dark that Farmer Hill
could not see the horse; he could not
see the trees; he could not see the
ground.</p>

<p>"Get-up," said Farmer Hill again.</p>

<p>Prince started forward; but this
time he turned out and went on
the grass at the side of the driveway.</p>

<p>"I wonder what can be the matter
there," said Farmer Hill.</p>

<p>John and mother were waiting
for father and came out on the back
porch as they heard the wheels
coming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"We were afraid something had
happened to you, it is so late,"
said mother.</p>

<p>Then father told them how the
bridge was gone and how Prince
had refused to go on.</p>

<p>"But I cannot understand," said
he, "why he would not come into
the yard by the driveway."</p>

<p>"I'll go and see," said John.</p>

<p>John took the lantern and went
down toward the road.</p>

<p>In a moment he came running back.</p>

<p>"Come here," he called. "That
big flash of lightning must have
struck here. There is a great hole
in the ground."</p>

<p>All ran to look.</p>

<p>There in the driveway was a
deep hole with the gravel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
earth and big stones thrown about
in all directions.</p>

<p>"And Prince could see that in
the dark!" said father. "Twice he
saved me from harm."</p>

<p>"He has wonderful eyes," said
mother, "and he used them well."</p>

<p>"I shall give him some extra oats
and a lump of sugar," said John.</p>
